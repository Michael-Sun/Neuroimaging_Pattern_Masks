1. All the results maps for this study are in the folder of MKDA_Maps.
2. In the folder of MKDA_Maps, there are two subfolders, including SB_FC and VBM. In the subfolder of SB_FC, there are resulting maps of DMN, FPN and SN. In the subfolder of VBM, there are the meta-analytic maps of VBM. 
3. In each subfolder of these three networks, dysconnectivity, hypoconnectivity and hyperconnectivity maps are included, individually.
   "_Pool" represents the meta-analytic maps with pooling effects of hypo- and hyperconnectivity.
   "_Dec" represents the meta-analytic maps of hypoconnectivity.
   "_Inc" represents the meta-analytic maps of hyperconnectivity.
4. In each subfolder of meta-analytic maps, two maps with extent-based and height-based threshold are included. 
   "_FWE_extent_stringent" represents the map with the stringent extent-based threshold (P < 0.001).
   "_FWE_height" represents the map with the height-based threshold (P < 0.05).
5. In each subfolder of meta-analytic maps, it also includes the table with coordinates that used to obtain corresponding meta-analytic map.
