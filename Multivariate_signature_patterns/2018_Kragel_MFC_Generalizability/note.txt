This directory contains .nii files for PLS models described in Kragel et al. (In press). Generalizable representations 
of pain, cognitive control, and negative emotion in medial frontal cortex. Nature Neuroscience.

The .nii files contain PLS regression coefficients (bPLS) from an analysis of fMRI activity from 18 different studies. The
files are named based on the region of interest used in the analysis (aMCC, dMFC, pACC, pMCC, sgACC, and vmPFC), and the 
functional domain being predicted (pain, cognitive control, or negative emotion).
