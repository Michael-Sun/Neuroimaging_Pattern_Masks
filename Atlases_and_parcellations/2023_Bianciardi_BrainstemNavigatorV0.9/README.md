### Brainstem Navigator v0.9 (aka Bianciardi atlas)

The Bianciardi atlas is an ongoing effort to map brainstem nuclei in vivo using high resolution multimodal MR. T1, T2 and diffusion fractional anisotrophy data is collected at 7T and structures are individually segmented in small samples of participants (10-20). Participants are aligned to the FSL standard space template (most likely MNI152NLin6Asym, but there's a slight possibility it's MNI152NLin6Sym) and an "IIT template" (which I'm unfamiliar with). A probablistic map is created based on overlap of the sample in this standard space. This project spans a number of publications over the past decade and remains ongoing, but is already at a sufficiently advanced stage to be useful.

Here the MNI152NLin6Sym space atlas is provided as well as a MNI152NLin2009cAsym space (fmriprep 20.0.3 default) space atlas. This atlas is provided in two parcellations, one with some subnuclear divisions (hires) and a lower resolution atlas. The hires atlas probably excedes the spatial precision of contemporary imaging in the wager lab, but may be useful when working with specialty datasets, as a reference or as technology evolves, so it is provided as well. Note, the resolution in question here is not the resolution of the NIFTI image, but rather of the parcellation. The NIFTI images in both cases are 1x1x1mm resolution.

In fact, you should be aware that many of these regions are extremely small, even in the default, non hires atlas. In this form it is most useful as a way of asigning labels to activation maps you may have or otherwise being used as a reference. If you need to define seed regions or targets you probably will want to try dilating some of these regions to have a more practical volume to work with.

### Data formatting

The nuclei have obscure names and in many cases multiple names. We have shorthand names in the atlas.labels field, but longer descriptions are also available in the atlas.label_description field. Further, a select number of regions are not in fact brainstem regions, specifically LGN, MGN and subthalamic nucleaus. The macroscopic structure is indicated by atlas.labels_2.

### Evaluation of atlas quality

The standard for brainstem nuclei in the Wager lab was established by CANLab 2018 (which predates this atlas). In CANLab2018 coordinates were aggregated from multiple studies, mostly pain studies, which reported task evoked responses in particular nuclei. Most of these studies were conducted between 2005-2010, and would be considered archaic by today's standards, but they had the advantage of linking anatomy with function or sometimes behavior for validation. The Bianciardi atlas does not do this for the most part (although see Bianciardi 2016). Consequently you should approach these regions with some skepticism. However, the atlas has thus far held up under my own scrutiny.

Some of the regions here disagree with those of CANLab2018. The raphe nuclei present an opportunity for robust comparison, since there are several of them distributed along the rostro-caudal axis of the brainstem and most express 5-HT transporter and 5-HT1a autoreceptors, for which we have multiple PET tracer maps available (Hansen et al, 2022). The viability of identifying these nuclei by 5-HT transporter ligand was established in a series of papers which identified 3-amin-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylthio) benzonitrile (DASB) as an effective ligand (Son Y et al. 2012 & Son Y et al. 2014). Hansen et al. provides two such maps and a third using a second 5-HT transporter ligand MADAM. Additionally, serotonin release appears regulated by 5-HT1a autoreceptors (Garcia-Garcia 2014), for which Hansen provides two more PET contrast maps using two different radioligands, offering a second independent method of validating the raphe nuclei. We can overlay the raphe parcels from the Bianciardi and CANLab2018 atlases onto the PET tracer maps to evaluate their relative accuracy.

Bianciardi offers the following raphe nuclei,
* Caudal-rostral linear raphe (CLi_RLi) (missing from canlab 2018)
* Dorsal raphe (DR)
* Median Raphe (MnR)
* Raphe Magnus (RMg)
* Raphe obscurus (ROb)
* Raphe pallidus (RPa) (missing from canlab2018)

Meanwhile CANLab2018 offers these,
* Dorsal raphe (Dorsal raphe DR)
* Median Raphe (Median Raphe MR R)
* Raphe Nucleus Centralis Superior (NCS B6 B8)
* Raphe Magnus (NRM)
* Medullary Raphe aka Raphe pallidus
* Nucleus raphe pontis (NRP B5) (missing from Bianciardi)

The first thing to notice is that they don't have identical coverage. Some ROIs are only in one but not the other. The other thing to notice is that CANLab2018 has both Median Raphe and Raphe Nucleus Centralis Superior which is a subdivision of the Median Raphe, but is suspect. Additionally the latter is associated with two nucleu, B6/B8. The B system is an independent numbering system for the Raphe to help distinguish them given redundant naming conventions, but this single nucleus is associated with two raphe nuclei. This might be fine for a nucleus with well defined boundaries, but the CANLab2018 ROIs are coordinate based and a 3 voxel sphere was simply drawn at those coordinates, so no meaningful subdivisions are possible.

How do these atlases compare when overlaid on the pet tracer data? All pet tracer overlays are available in the tracer_overlays directory of this folder, but I want to highlight three key ones. All overlays are using the MNI152NLin6Asym space of the Bianciardi atlas, since the CANLab2018 atlas doesn't use a single consistent space. Bianciardi is outlined in light blue, while CANLab2018 is outlined in white.

![Beliveau_5HTT](tracer_overlays/raphe_vs_dsab_beliveau_5HTT.png)
A high resolution map of DSAB ligand binding on 5-HT transporter shows good overlap with Bianciardi's Raphe (blue), but the CANLab2018 shows some outliers (white). In particular a nucleus near the pons is in a 5-HTT deadzone. This atlas is masked in the subthalamic area though so it's hard to judge the accuracy of the CLi-RLi structure which extends into that masked region. For that we turn to the next tracer map.

![Salvi_5HTT](tracer_overlays/raphe_vs_dsab_salvi_5HTT.png)
As you can see, this DSAB ligand binding map is truncated in the caudal arts of the image, but not in the subthalamic area where it shows good overlap with the CLi-Rli structure of Bianciardi (blue). We can corroborate these results by looking at binding for 5-HT1a autoreceptor, which will be less specific but should also be collocalized with the raphe nuclei

![Beliveau_5HT1a](tracer_overlays/raphe_vs_cumi_beliveau_5HT1a.png)
CUMI ligand binding map shows location of 5-HT1a sites that collocalize with the more dorsal Bianciardi atlas (blue) better than the more ventral CANLab2018 structures (white).

These results give me confidence that the approach taken by Bianciardi's group in their atlas construction works fairly well, although you should still find ways of corroborating any nuclear location with additional sources if it's critical to your question.

### Methods

The mapping from the MNI152NLin6Asym space to MNI152NLin2009cAsym space was performed using transformations computed by Lead-DBS in conjunction with Vladimir Fonov from the MNI. The transforms were obtained here,

https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/MNI_T1_6thGen_NLIN_to_MNI_2009b_NLIN_ANTs_transform/3502238

antsApplyTransform from the fmriprep 20.0.3 LTS singularity container was used to perform the alignment on the to probablistic versions of the parcels and was implemented by the script warp_to_MNI152NLin2009cAsym0.sh. This was in turn invoked by warp_to_MNI152NLin2009cAsym.sh on the Dartmouth HPC system. The probablistic versions of the parcels were then used to regenerate the atlas in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space, and the result is also provided in this directory.
