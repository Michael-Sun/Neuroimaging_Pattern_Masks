BCBlib: neuroimaging analyses 
=============================

All the maps can be found on www.bcblab.com under open data --> Atlas of Human Brain Connection (latest version as of June 2021). The same atlas is also in software BCBtoolkit (http:/toolkit.bcblab.com).

According to Michel Thiebaut, 2020 NATCOMMS divided the white matter anatomy into components (not tracts per se). These components seem to explain the functional segregation of the brain very well. They are also available in neurovault https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:7735 (see data availability section in their paper).

The white matter of the neurosynth database can be found here
