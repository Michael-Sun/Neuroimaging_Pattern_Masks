The original parcellation appears to be in Colin27 space. This is based on the fact that the reference paper says it used
BioImage Suite. If you download bioimage suite and look at its source image it looks identical to a skull stripped version
of Colin27. When you then overlay the shen parcels on the Colin27 it shows perfect alignment, but misalignment when used
on MNI152NLin6Asym (FSL6 standard template) or MNI152NLin2009cAsym (fmriprep standard template). This is most obvious in
the ventral parts of the brain where Colin27 is most atypical.
