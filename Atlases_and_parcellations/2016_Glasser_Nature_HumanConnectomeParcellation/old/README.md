The code in this folder is deprecated. It's based on a dubious projection from surface space to volumetric space
that's based on nearest neighbor interpolation without seemingly any realignments performed. A registration
fusion approach was used to generate a more credible alignment and is available in the parent directory. This is
left here for backwards compatability.
