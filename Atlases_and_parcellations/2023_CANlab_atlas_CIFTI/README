This is a cifti version of the canlab2018_2mm atlas. It was generated by resampling subcortical volumes to the cifti
volumetric space at 2mm resolution. The mapping from complete subcortical voxel space to the cifti strutcure specific
spaces resulted in some ROIs overlapping off-target structures, e.g. thalamic ROIs overlapping with the hippocampal fornix
or some such. Some minor manual edits were made to correct these mislabelings. CANLab2018 cortical parcelations were
replaced entirely by the original glasser parcellation which was obtained from the mmp atlas in the hcp_utils package:
