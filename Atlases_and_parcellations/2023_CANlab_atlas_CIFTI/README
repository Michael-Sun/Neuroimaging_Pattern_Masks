This is a cifti version of the canlab2018_2mm atlas. It was generated by resampling subcortical volumes to the cifti
volumetric space at 2mm resolution. The mapping from complete subcortical voxel space to the cifti strutcure specific
spaces resulted in some ROIs overlapping off-target structures, e.g. thalamic ROIs overlapping with the hippocampal fornix
or some such. Some minor manual edits were made to correct these mislabelings. CANLab2018 cortical parcelations were
replaced entirely by the original glasser parcellation which was obtained from the mmp atlas in the hcp_utils package:

cifti visualization is best done using connectome workbench which you can get here:

Data files and surface models are stored separately for cifti files. There's no structure in my dlabel.nii atlas file for 
instance. It can be visualized on any surface model you like. Sometimes it's helpful to visualize things on an inflated 
surface to be able to get a better view into sulci. So in order to visualize any data in connectome workbench you also need 
the surface mesh models to which your data maps. I've found the hcp_utils git repo helpful for this.

Also if you need other parcellations in this space I've found this git repo helpful:

That includes the glasser atlas (as does the HCP repo, they call it MMP), but also several other surface atlases that may
be of use.
