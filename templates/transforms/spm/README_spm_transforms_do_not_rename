Here is some example code for applying the affine matrices:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

moving_img = spm_vol('img.nii') % image you want to transform
fixed_img = spm_vol('MNI152NLin2009cAsym_T1_1mm.nii') % your reference image defining the space you want to get into

M = csvread('00_fsl_to_fmriprep_AffineTransform.csv')

spm_get_space('img.nii', M*moving_img.mat);
spm_reslice({'MNI152NLin2009cAsym_T1_1mm.nii', 'img.nii'},...
            {'interp', 1, 'mask', 1, 'mean', 0, 'which', 1, 'wrap', [0,0,0]'});

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Meanwhile the warpfields can be applied from the batch GUI using the
"normalise: write" option under spatial transforms. It's fairly self 
explanatory.


Note: 
This file should not be renamed because it's used by some scripts to identify this folder. The transform warp fields
are too big to store on github, so we download them on demand and our scripts need to be able to know where to put them.
