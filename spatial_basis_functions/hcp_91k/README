These spectral basis functions were generated for instructional purposes during
the journal club discussion of Pang et al. (2023) Nature. They provide spatial
harmonics of cortical and subcortical structures of the hcp 91k midthickness
surfaces and 2mm subcortical volumes. The specific surface meshes used are 
available in the hcp_utils repo,

Surface harmonics were generated using spharapy with inverse euclidean 
distance edge weights. Pang et al. used finite element methods. See the 
spharapy docs for theoretical considerations related to this choice.

Inverse euclidean distance was used because it's easier to implement manually
and for subcortical harmonics I had to manually construct adjacency matrices,
including manual computation of a distance metric.

Subcortical basis functions were generated using a manually generated adjacency
representation of subcortical structures. Each voxel defines a node, and all
voxels are connected to any voxel with which they share a surface, edge or
corner, so called 26-connectivity. Edge weights are also inverse euclidean 
distance. This was implemented manually using networkx in python. The graph
laplacian was then computed manally and its eigenfunctions were used to define
the eigenmodes of subcortical structures. Alternative graph representations
include 6 and 18-connectivity as well as tetrahedral representations like those
used by Pang et al. (2023) Nature. It's unclear which is best, but Pang offers
a method of evaluating spectral representations in terms of functional gradients
which could be used as an objective criteria to select one representation over
another. I have not explored this.

:: Visualization ::

cifti visualization is best done using connectome workbench which you can get here:
	https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench
Data files and surface models are stored separately for cifti files. There's no structure in my dsalar.nii 
file for instance. It can be visualized on any surface model you like (although, note that it only represents
the spatial bases of a specific surface, see above). Sometimes it's helpful to visualize things on an inflated 
surface to be able to get a better view into sulci. So in order to visualize any data in connectome workbench 
you also need the surface mesh models to which your data maps. I've found the hcp_utils git repo helpful for 
this.

Also if you need other parcellations in this space I've found this git repo helpful:
	https://github.com/DiedrichsenLab/fs_LR_32
That includes the glasser atlas (as does the HCP repo, they call it MMP), but also several other surface atlases that may
be of use. If you need the canlab2018_2mm atlas (glasser + subcortical) it's available in this repo.
