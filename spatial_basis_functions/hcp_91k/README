These spectral basis functions were generated for instructional purposes during
the journal club discussion of Pang et al. (2023) Nature. The provide spatial
harmonics of cortical and subcortical structures of the hcp 91k midthickness
surfaces and 2mm subcortical volumes. Surface harmonics were generated using
spharapy with inverse euclidean distance edge weights. Pang et al. used finite
element methods. See the spharapy docs for theoretical considerations related
to this choice.

Subcortical basis functions were generated using a manually generated adjacency
representation of subcortical structures. Each voxel defines a node, and all
voxels are connected to any voxel with which they share a surface, edge or
corner, so called 26-connectivity. Edge weights are also inverse euclidean 
distance. This was implemented manually using networkx in python. The graph
laplacian was then computed manally and its eigenfunctions were used to define
the eigenmodes of subcortical structures.
